				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project branches off from the previous project, and synthesises the tiling object I previously made with image specific functions and transforms.
					For this piece I wanted to build off of a personal photography project of mine, and ultimately this project will help me make it interactive. 
					=Using collage and mirroring, my personal project refracts an image into tiles
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Technically I developed a series of experiments with the aim to deal with diffraction, I learned a lot on code smells and refactoring code in order to make it maintainable across experiments.
					 I also learned more about p5js funky image placement and functions such as push() and pop(). 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Utimately I liked the process of creating these series of work due to the experimental and explorative aspects of building off of one another</p>

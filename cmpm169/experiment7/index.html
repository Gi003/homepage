				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this project. I had seen this graphic design post in my feed a while ago, and I liked how it visualized a calendar in a fun way so I decided to try to imitate it in my work and try to add  some animation to it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For the highlighted days I used a csv file with important dates and holidays per year such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Valentine's Day, Pi Day, Earth Day and more. I was then able to look up the objects in my canvas with the column information in the csv which was month and date, and highlight them.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>To make it a little more special I added noise to the spiral along two axis. Now when the user moves the mouse, the calendar turns into a chaotic blob of colors. Representing how delicate a year can be and how small it looks in the coil of the canvas. To keep it still to the original the user has to move the mouse close to the top right corner</p>

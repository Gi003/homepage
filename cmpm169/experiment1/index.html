				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this piece, I decided to animate lines depending on the input of mouse movement. The vector aspect of the assignment reminded me of the geometric grids</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For this piece I had to calculate vectors relating from a specific point on the screen to the cursor. I had to find the direction vector from point A to point B. Normalize that vector, and scale it in order to keep all the lines of equal length </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I found the beggining brainstorming stage to be the most confusing and scary. I was only able to think of something interesting to do when I closed my laptop and doodled or thought of projects I had seen in the past. </p>

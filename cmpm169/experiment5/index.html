				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this assignment I decided to branch out from p5js and code with three.js exclusively.
					I also learned blender in order to 3D model assets and position them into an interactive 3D scene 
					resembling my bedroom with 2D shapes. This project is late because while I was learning a lot
					I didnt believe the outcome was impressive enough and I plan to keep working on this 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I learned three js and how to set up a camera, scene, materials and mesh along with importing extensions to 
					three js in an importmap which I had never used. I also learned the geometric primitives in blender 
					and how to position and rotate them 
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I might say this was my least favorite experiment yet and I think that is due to my lack of inspiration for this topic.</p>
